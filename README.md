# SmartMirror

This is a smart mirror I created that displays helpful information such as the date, time, my game stats, etc. I get this information by using APIs for weather, alerts, and game stats. The APIs are from APIXU and Steam API services. When creating the code, I looked at Hacker Shack's smart mirror code as a reference. You can view that code [here](https://github.com/HackerShackOfficial/Smart-Mirror). I built the code and the frame during the summer and it currently hangs in my room.

You can get a steam API key [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

You can get an APIXU key by creating an account and registering for one [here](https://www.apixu.com/signup.aspx).
